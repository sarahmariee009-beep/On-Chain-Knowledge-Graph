# üß† On-Chain Knowledge Graph

> A revolutionary decentralized knowledge management system that creates a community-verified, immutable network of interconnected knowledge nodes on the Stacks blockchain.

## üåü Overview

The On-Chain Knowledge Graph is a sophisticated smart contract ecosystem that enables the creation, verification, and querying of structured knowledge through a decentralized graph database. By combining blockchain immutability with community-driven validation, we create a trustless environment where knowledge is collaboratively built, verified, and preserved for posterity.

## üöÄ Usage Guide

### For Knowledge Contributors

Create a comprehensive knowledge node:

```clarity
(create-knowledge-node
  u2  ;; NODE-TYPE-FACT
  "Photosynthesis Process"
  "Photosynthesis is the biological process by which plants, algae, and certain bacteria convert light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose molecules, releasing oxygen as a byproduct."
  "The process occurs in two main stages: light-dependent reactions in the thylakoids convert light energy to ATP and NADPH, while light-independent reactions in the stroma use CO2, ATP, and NADPH to synthesize glucose through the Calvin cycle. This process is fundamental to most life on Earth as it produces oxygen and forms the base of most food chains."
  "Biology"  ;; domain
  (list "photosynthesis" "plants" "biology" "energy" "oxygen")  ;; tags
  (list "Campbell Biology 11th Edition, Chapter 10" "Nature Plants Journal 2020" "NCBI Photosynthesis Review")  ;; citations
)
```

### For Relationship Mapping

Connect knowledge nodes with semantic relationships:

```clarity
(create-knowledge-edge
  u1   ;; source-node (Photosynthesis Process)
  u2   ;; target-node (Chloroplast)
  u5   ;; EDGE-TYPE-PART-OF
  "Photosynthesis occurs within chloroplasts, the specialized organelles containing chlorophyll and other photosynthetic machinery"
  u95  ;; relationship strength (1-100)
)
```

### For Knowledge Verification

Verify and validate knowledge contributions:

```clarity
(verify-knowledge-node
  u1   ;; node-id
  u92  ;; accuracy score (0-100)
  u88  ;; relevance score (0-100)
  u90  ;; citation quality (0-100)
  "Excellent scientific accuracy with high-quality peer-reviewed sources. Content is comprehensive and well-structured for the target domain."
)
```

### For Semantic Relationship Verification

Validate edge relationships between knowledge nodes:

```clarity
(verify-knowledge-edge
  u1   ;; edge-id
  u94  ;; logical correctness (0-100)
  u87  ;; relationship strength assessment (0-100)
  u89  ;; evidence quality (0-100)
)
```

### For Knowledge Discovery

Query the knowledge graph for information:

```clarity
(query-knowledge-graph
  (list "photosynthesis" "chloroplast" "energy" "plants")  ;; search terms
  u1   ;; query type (1=semantic, 2=structural, 3=statistical)
)
```
